# Color Sorting Pick and Place Robot


This project aims to create a versatile pick and place robot system that efficiently 
sorts objects by their colors, with the goal of enhancing industrial automation 
processes. We are leveraging the capabilities of Universal Robots, known for 
their precision and versatility, as the core of our manipulator system. To optimize 
object handling, we are integrating the Robotio 3F Gripper. The simulation and 
testing of this system are carried out in Webots, a dynamic simulation 
environment. C++, C, and other languages were used for programming, and this 
project primarily utilizes C.
Through the collaboration of Universal Robots and the Robotio 3F Gripper, we 
are developing a highly dexterous and accurate robotic system capable of sorting 
objects based on their colors. Webots serves as a comprehensive simulation 
platform, enabling realistic replication of conveyor belt operations and colorbased object recognition, as well as the development and testing of control 
algorithms. The primary objective is to create an adaptable pick and place robot 
that can significantly enhance automation across various industrial sectors, 
boosting productivity, reducing errors, and improving material handling 
efficiency.
